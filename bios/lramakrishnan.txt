Lavanya Ramakrishnan is a scientist in the Advanced Computing for
Science department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Her research
interests are in software tools for computational and data-intensive
science. Currently, she is actively engaged in projects exploring
programming templates for data analysis workflow composition and data
management techniques for elastic transient environments. She is also
involved in projects evaluating cloud and big data technologies such
as Hadoop and NoSQL databases for scientific applications and
performance, energy and fault-tolerance trade-offs in infrastructure
strategies. Ramakrishnan has also worked closely with scientists from
multiple domains including bioinformatics, biomedical science,
storm-surge modeling, weather modeling, high-energy physics and light
source facilities.

She has previously worked as a research staff member at
Renaissance Computing Institute and MCNC in North Carolina. She has
masters and doctoral degrees from Indiana University and a bachelor
degree in computer engineering from VJTI, University of Mumbai. She
joined LBL as an Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellow in 2009.
