Top 6 Projects, 2-3 sentences each.

1. Materials Project Center for Functional Electronic Materials. The Materials Project is a high-throughput framework developed by MIT and LBNL and subsequently extended by collaborators at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC). This Center, funded by the DOE BES Predictive Theory and Modeling for Materials and Chemical Sciences program, will extend the Materials Project with high-throughput calculations, state-of-the-art electronic structure methods as well as novel data mining algorithms for surface, defect, electronic and finite temperature property predictions -- to yield an unparalleled materials design environment.
Personnel: Dan Gunter

2. Template Interfaces for Agile Parallel Data-Intensive Science (Tigres). Enabling collaborative analysis of DOE Science data through a new concept of reusable "templates" that enable scientists to easily compose, run, and manage collaborative computational tasks.
Personnel: Deb Agarwal, Lavanya Ramakrishnan, Dan Gunter

DOE User Facilities and large science collaborations are increasingly
generating large datasets. Analysis of this data requires an ability
to compose at the desktop and easily scale to run at HPC facilities,
but with current technologies, scaling an analysis to an HPC center
and to a large dataset is difficult even for experts. Tigres is
addressing the challenge of enabling collaborative analysis of DOE
Science data through a new concept of reusable computational patterns
or "templates" that enable scientists to easily compose, run, and
manage collaborative computational tasks. 


3. ESnet eXtensible SNMP System. Transition current tools to use a more scalable data storage backend, time series data modeling and development of new analytics tools.
Personnel: Monte Goode

4. Assembly likelihood estimation (ALE). Error prediction, and quantification of genome assembly
Personnel: Taghrid Samak

5. KBase. The Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) is a collaborative effort designed to accelerate our understanding of microbes, microbial communities, and plants. It will be a community-driven, extensible and scalable open-source software framework and application system. Our team is helping with design and development of the user interfaces through a user-centered design process.
Personnel: Dan Gunter, Sarah Poon

6. IRMO: Infrastructure Strategy to Support Collaboration. Scientific
collaborations/communities require an elastic, transient
infrastructure strategy that will enable opportunities for data
analysis, data movement, and data storage. Building on the experiences
of the Magellan project, we adapt and extend the recently emerged
trends, in particular cloud computing and virtualization, to define,
investigate, and develop tools allowing providers to provide a
resource model with provisioning offers, in particular elastic,
autoscaling, and integrated compute and storage
resources. Specifically, at LBNL we are focused on an effective,
efficient, flexible, robust data-managent solution suited for
different data access patterns for scientific applications.
